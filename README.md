# Practice 2: the 'Night of the Fire' 2D. Simulation.

Simulation subject within the Multimedia Engineering degree from the ETSE - Universitat de València. March 2022. Practice 2. Rating 7. The aim is to simulate a fireworks display to recreate (partially and only in 2 dimensions) the Night of Fire of the Fallas of Valencia.

## Project setup
The user can add fireworks by clicking the mouse and they will start from the bottom of the screen and explode where the mouse clicked. A total of 6 different types of fireworks have been implemented and the user has the possibility of modifying which ones to simulate. To do this you must press different keys:
  - Key 0, activates the creation of circle-shaped fireworks.
  - Key 1, activates the creation of fireworks in the shape of a palm tree.
  - Key 2, activates the creation of heart-shaped fireworks.
  - Key 3, activates the creation of fireworks in the shape of a diagonal line.
  - Key 4, activates the creation of fireworks in the shape of a vertical line.
  - Key 5, activates the creation of spiral-shaped fireworks.
  - Key 6, activates the random creation of fireworks (all of the above).

By default, the system will have random creation enabled. In addition, a wind model has been implemented in the system that simulates that the different particles are subjected to the force of the wind. The user has the possibility, using the arrows, to modify this force, both its magnitude and its direction.
